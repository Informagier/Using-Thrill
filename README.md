# Using-Thrill
A complete Thrill environment with demo code

To compile your code, do NOT execute compile.sh.
Instead you should build your executable via __build.sh__.

This will create a docker container and compile your project within
a ubuntu xenial container. Therefore you do not have to install any other
dependency other than __docker__.

I wish you luck on this thrillride.
